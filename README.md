# predicting-profit-for-a-new-restaurant-franchise
*Goal - 
Predicting the profit for a new restaurent outlet in a new city based on the population in that particular city.

Packages used are - Numpy,Matplotlib,Copy,Math

- Dataset

  - x_train is the population of a city
  - y_train is the profit of a restaurant in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.   
  - Both X_train and y_train are numpy arrays.
 
 - x_train is a numpy array that contains decimal values that are all greater than zero.These values represent the city population times 10,000. For example, 6.1101 means that the population for that city is 61,101

- Similarly, y_train is a numpy array that has decimal values, some negative, some positive.
  - These represent your restaurant's average monthly profits in each city, in units of \$10,000.
  - For example, 17.592 represents \$175,920 in average monthly profits for that city.
  - -2.6807 represents -\$26,807 in average monthly loss for that city.
